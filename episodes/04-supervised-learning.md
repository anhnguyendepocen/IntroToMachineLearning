## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the branch of Machine Learning (ML) that involves predicting labels, such as 'Survived' or 'Not'. Such models learn from labelled data, which is data that includes whether a passenger survived (called "model training"), and then predict on unlabeled data.

These are generally called train and test sets because
- You want to build a model that learns patterns in the training set, and
- You then use the model to make predictions on the test set.

We can then calculate the percentage that you got correct: this is known as the accuracy of your model.

### How To Start with Supervised Learning

As you might already know, a good way to approach supervised learning is the following:
- Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on your data set;
- Build a quick and dirty model, or a baseline model, which can serve as a comparison against later models that you will build;
- Iterate this process. You will do more EDA and build another model;
- Engineer features: take the features that you already have and combine them or extract more information from them to eventually come to the last point, which is
- Get a model that performs better.
