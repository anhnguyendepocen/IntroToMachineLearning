### Overview
Machine learning has emerged as a discipline that enables computers to assist humans in making sense of large and complex data sets. With the drop-in cost of sequencing technologies, large amounts of omics data are being generated and made accessible to researchers. Analysing these complex high-volume data is not trivial and the use of classical tools cannot explore their full potential. Machine learning can thus be very useful in mining large omics datasets to uncover new insights that can advance the field of medicine and improve health care.

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce participants to the Machine learning (ML) taxonomy and common machine learning algorithms. The tutorial will cover the methods being used to analyse different omics data sets by providing a practical context through the use of basic but widely used R and Python libraries. The tutorial will comprise a number of hands on exercises and challenges, where the participants will acquire a first understanding of the standard ML processes as well as the practical skills in applying them on familiar problems and publicly available real-world data sets.

### Learning objectives

- Understand the ML taxonomy and the commonly used machine learning algorithms for analysing “omics” data
- Understand differences between ML algorithms categories and to which kind of problem they can be applied
- Understand different applications of ML in different -omics studies
- Use some basic, widely used Python and R packages for ML
- Interpret and visualize the results obtained from ML analyses on omics datasets
- Apply the ML techniques to analyse their own datasets

### Audience and requirements

This introductory tutorial is aimed towards bioinformaticians (graduate students and researchers) familiar with different omics data technologies that are interested in applying machine learning to analyse them.

### Prerequisites

- Previous experience in Bioinformatics analysis
- Familiarity with any programming language (especially R) is preferable but not necessary

_Maximum participants_: 30
